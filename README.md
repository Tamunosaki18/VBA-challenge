In summary table 1 (Yearly stock), i created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and output ticker symbol, yearly chane, percentage change and total stock volume of the stock.Condition formatting was also applied to the yearly change and percent change.

In summary table 2, A nd i also added the functionality to my script to return with the "Greatest % increase","Greatest % decrease",and "Greatest total volume", which ran through on every work sheet and displayed in the output.
